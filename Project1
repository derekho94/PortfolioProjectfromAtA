Portfolio Project Text: 
	Data was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
order by 1,2

--Comparing Total Cases vs Total Deaths across different countries
--Shows likelihood of dying if you contract Covid in your country

Select Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
Where Location = 'Vietnam'
order by 1,2

--Had to convert total_cases & total_deaths from nonvarchar to numeric via formula below
--Alter Table dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Alter Column total_cases numeric
--Preliminary review of Vietnam shows that DeathPercentage was never >3% unlike most other countries during peak covid periods

--Now we will look at the percentage of the population that contracted Covid
Select Location, date, total_cases, Population, (total_cases/Population)*100 as TransmissionPercentage
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Where Location = 'Vietnam'
order by 1,2

-- Next, we will compare the highest infection rates with a country's population
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, MAX((total_cases/Population))*100 as PercentPopluationInfected
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Where Location = 'Vietnam'
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopluationInfected desc

-- Showing Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

Select Location, MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Where Location = 'Vietnam'
Group by Location
order by TotalDeathCount desc

--Note: If I did not convert the total_deaths earlier to numeric, I would have ran into an error using the Max Function. 
--Example to work around nonvarchar value with MAX - MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int))

--Roadblock: When viewing the locations, we have locations like World, South America, etc are showing. The data is grouping entire continents alongside countries. 

Select * 
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
Order by 3,4

--Issue is due to some continents being null and continent name is insertted into location still. 

Select * 
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
Where continent is not null
Order by 3,4

--Insert where condition into previous function will eliminate this roadblock.

Select Location, MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Where Location = 'Vietnam'
Where continent is not null
Group by Location
order by TotalDeathCount desc

--US TDC is 1127152 at number 1 while Vietnam's TDC is 43206 at number 27
--Now let's break things down by continent and explore further

Select continent, MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
Where continent is not null
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc

--Only 6 countries listed and NA is listed separately from SA. 

Select Location, MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
Where continent is null
Group by Location
order by TotalDeathCount desc

--Including null entries changes the data drastically - this may interfere with drill-down features within Tableau when visualizing. 
--Project will continue forward ignoring this for now. 

--Showing continents with the highest death count per population

Select continent, MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
Where continent is not null
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc

--Global Numbers - We are viewing the total amount of cases, deaths, and the percentage within the world at any given date. 
--Kept receiving 'divide by zero error' - tried fixing by adjusting the date but instead used the NULLIF function within the percentage formula to avoid dividing by zero

Select date, SUM(new_cases) as GlobalCases, SUM(new_deaths) as GlobalDeaths, Sum(new_deaths)/NULLIF(Sum(new_cases),0)*100 as GlobalDeathPercentage
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Where Location like '%states%'
Where continent is not null 
Group by date
order by 1,2

--Total Global Cases, Deaths, and Case-to-Death Percentage
Select SUM(new_cases) as GlobalCases, SUM(new_deaths) as GlobalDeaths, Sum(new_deaths)/NULLIF(Sum(new_cases),0)*100 as GlobalDeathPercentage
From dbo.CovidDeaths$
--Where Location like '%states%'
Where continent is not null 
--Group by date
order by 1,2

--Now let's include our vaccinations table via join so that we can compare Total Population vs Vaccinations
--Let's count the new number of vaccinations as time moves on and add a Partition by statement so that we only count by countries. 

Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(Cast(vac.new_vaccinations as numeric)) OVER 
(Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location,dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From dbo.CovidDeaths$ as dea
Join dbo.CovidVaccinations$ as vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null
order by 2,3

-- Could use this with an additional Where condition to drill down on specific locations
-- Now, if we wanted to find the RollingPeopleVaccinated Percentage, then we need to create a CTE or Temp Table since 
-- we cannot select a column that was just created in Select

--CTE Example
With PopvsVac (continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as 
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(Cast(vac.new_vaccinations as numeric)) OVER 
(Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location,dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From dbo.CovidDeaths$ as dea
Join dbo.CovidVaccinations$ as vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null
--order by 2,3
)
Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100 as RollingPeopleVaccinatedPercentage
From PopvsVac

--Adding an additional Where clause allows us to drill down on specific locations

--Temp Table Example (Drop table is handy if the table needs to be updated)
Drop Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Create Table #PercentPopluationVaccinated
(
continent nvarchar(255), 
location nvarchar(255), 
date datetime, 
population numeric,
new_vaccinations numeric,
RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)
Insert Into #PercentPopluationVaccinated
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(Cast(vac.new_vaccinations as numeric)) OVER 
(Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location,dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From dbo.CovidDeaths$ as dea
Join dbo.CovidVaccinations$ as vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null
--order by 2,3

Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100 as RollingPeopleVaccinatedPercentage
From #PercentPopluationVaccinated

--Creating View to store data for visualizations in Tableau

Create View PercentPopulationVaccinatedUS as 
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(Cast(vac.new_vaccinations as numeric)) OVER 
(Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location,dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From dbo.CovidDeaths$ as dea
Join dbo.CovidVaccinations$ as vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null and dea.location = 'United States'
--order by 2,3

Select * 
From PercentPopulationVaccinated

--Created Views were for PercentPopulation Vaccinated for Global, the US, and Vietnam for further analysis
